- The game now scale properly
- Bosses will effectively respawn if you replay
- better tutorial
- some zombies will be out of range but will bet back into the fold after a bit to increase tension
- Both guns now have excluded dead zone meaning you are forced to use both if you want to win level 1 2 3 4
- fix for some corner case where loosing near end of song would cause game reset
